# Building-a-Spam-Filter-with-Naive-Bayes

In this project we will buil a spam filter for SMS messages using Naive Bayes alorithm. To train the algorithm, we will use a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are classified by humans as spam or ham. The dataset is located in The UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The aim of this project is to create a spam filter that clssifies new messages with an accuracy greater than 80%, this means we expect that more than 80% of the new messages will be classified correctly as spam or no spam.
